# StardewArtifactTracker
A script that, at the start of each new Stardew day, will print out a list of artifact spot locations.

Place it in the folder that contains your save. Then, run it as follows:
```
python3 artifact_script.py testchar1_235364326
```
(where testchar1_235364326 is replaced by the name of the corresponding file in your folder).

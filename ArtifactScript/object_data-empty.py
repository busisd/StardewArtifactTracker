The data variable above should be set to the value of the unpacked version of ObjectInformation.xnb.
A quick guide is as follows:
 - Find the file ObjectInformation.xnb
   > Try C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Content\Data
 - Unpack ObjectInformation.xnb into a .json file
   > https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Editing_XNB_files#Unpack_game_files gives a good tutorial
     for how to do this
 - Copy the dictionary that appears in "content": { ... } and paste it into this file, so that
   data will be equal to that dictionary
 - Rename this file to object_data.py by removing the '-empty' in the filename
